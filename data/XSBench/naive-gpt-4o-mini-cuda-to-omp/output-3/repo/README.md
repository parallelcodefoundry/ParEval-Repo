XSBench is a mini-app representing a key computational kernel of the Monte Carlo neutron transport algorithm. Specifically, XSBench represents the continuous energy macroscopic neutron cross section lookup kernel. XSBench serves as a lightweight stand-in for full neutron transport applications like [OpenMC](https://github.com/openmc-dev/openmc), and is a useful tool for performance analysis on high performance computing architectures.
